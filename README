Here we experiment with the Pannellum software to show panoramas within GitHub Pages.
Notes:
(1) To test locally, we need to start a webserver ($ python3 -m http.server) in the folder of the index.html file, then open each panorama's URL (e.g. http://0.0.0.0:8000/website/p01.html) in a browser (cross-origin protection).
(2) We are using the online versions of the Pannellum scripts (JS and CSS), we had no luck with the downloaded ones - possibly a problem with paths.
(3) Panoramas are generated (into multi-resolution tiles) with script data/generate.py. Useful flag: -q 85 to set the JPEG quality of the tiles. Original images should have full 360x180 coverage (possibly black zenith or similar).
